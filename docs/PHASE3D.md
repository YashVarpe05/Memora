# Stage 1 — filtered retrieval

Recorded 2026-08-26T09:54:07+00:00, commit `88a3510`.

**Query understanding is ON.** Compare against `BASELINE.md`, which is the
same corpus and gold set with stage 1 disabled.

## What was measured

- Corpus: 14 documents, 377 chunks
- Gold set: 23 queries (19 retrieval, 4 refusal)
- Retrieval: dense cosine over `gemini-embedding-001` at 768 dims, with stage 1 filters applied as boosts.
- Evaluated against an already-indexed corpus, verified by content hash.

## Stage 1 calls skipped

**15 stage 1 calls for 23 queries, cold.** The free tier allows 20 generate requests a day, so a cold run fits in one day's budget; a run without skipping needs 23 and does not.

Cold is the number that matters for planning. A warm cache serves most of these rows for free, so the calls actually issued by any given run may be far fewer — which is why this says *required*, not *spent*.

Skipped means the query carried no source-type word, no sender and no date, so stage 1 had nothing to extract. Skipping cannot improve a result — it can only fail to help one. Rows skipped:

| row | query | rank | predicted harm |
|---|---|---|---|
| q002 | the project report about ai agents that write code | 1 | none predicted |
| q003 | the synopsis about checking code for mistakes | 1 | none predicted |
| q004 | the project about making websites do things on their own | 1 | none predicted |

## Stage 1 cost

An extra model call on every search. Measured across these queries:

- median 4219 ms, range 3059-5225 ms
- added to every search, before any retrieval happens

## Top-score distribution

Raw top similarity per query - the number refusal is decided on. Rows that
should refuse must fall below rows that should not; where they interleave,
no single threshold separates them and refusal needs a different signal.

## Observed fetch-window behaviour

The window widens until enough documents surface rather than using a fixed size.
Observed across these queries:

- chunks examined: 200–377
- widenings: 2–3
- corpus: 377 chunks, so the window reached 100% of it at most

**Known bound.** A document whose only matching chunk falls outside the window is
invisible. This bounds *list completeness*, not the top hit — a strong match puts a
chunk near the top of any window — so Recall@5 erodes before Recall@1 does. At
roughly a thousand documents the ceiling (2000 chunks) starts to bind, and the fix
is a document-level pre-filter rather than a larger window.

## Known limitations at the time of measurement

- **No visual understanding.** OCR extracts text; it does not describe pictures. Three corpus files contain no text and are therefore unfindable by any query.
- **`document_identity` is unmeasured.** The corpus contains no photograph of an ID card, so the flagship query type has no gold row. This is the largest gap.
- **Refusal is not enforced by the system.** `MIN_SIMILARITY_UNCALIBRATED` is 0.35 and gibberish scores ~0.489, so the threshold never fires. Any refusal recorded here came from the corpus being genuinely empty of matches, not from the guard.
- **Tesseract is the only working OCR engine.** PaddleOCR installs and cannot run on this hardware, in the container as well as on Windows.
